# Algorithm uses Two Pointer Technique. O(n^2)
# (1) 'for loop' moves 'i'
# (2) nested within that loop is a 'while loop' which moves the L & R pointers.
# (3) to find the right combination to equal target. answer = nums[i] + nums[L] + nums[R]
# (4) 'answer' value is compared with 'target' value.
#                   i  L ->      <- R
# eg. iteration 1: [1, 3, 5, 8, 18, 7]
#
#                      i  L ->   <- R
# eg. iteration 2: [1, 3, 5, 8, 18, 7]
